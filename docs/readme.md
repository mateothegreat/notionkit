## Prerequisites

### Notion API key

You need to have a Notion API key. You can get one from the Notion API documentation.

> [!NOTE]
> You can get your API key from [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations).

### Config file

You need to have a config file. You can create one by running `npx cmskit notion config`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mateothegreat/notion-sync
```

## Usage

### Get a Notion API Token

You will need to create an internal Notion integration. You will also want to share your database with the integration.

Your token will look like this: `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`

```ts
import { notion } from "@mateothegreat/notion-sync";
```
